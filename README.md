# Pipelined_MIPS_Processor
The project aims to design a Pipelined 32-Bit MIPS Micro-Processor (RISC-Like Harvard Architecture), Using Verilog HDL. It has early branch prediction and provides a hazard control unit that handles both data and control hazards by (Forwarding, Stalling, Flushing), the processor is simulated on ModelSim tool.
